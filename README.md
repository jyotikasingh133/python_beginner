## Programming with Python 

#### Total Time : 21 days

-- Session 1 --

Part 1 : install python, setup batch file to run the code easily

Part 2 : Basics of Python

		Basic tutorial : (I/O, variable, conditional statements, Array, functions)
		Program of AP, GP  (using iteration only)
		Factorial (using iteration, Stack, Recursion)

Part 3 : installing external libraries using pip command example (graphics)

		Draw shapes(Line, rectangle, circle, TextLabel)
		Visualize factorial in concentric circles

Home Work : 

    	Draw concentric circles for AP, GP series
		Program of AP, GP using Recursion and Stack
		Addition program using arrays :  
		[9,9,9] + [9,9] = [1,0,9,8] (asked in Google)

-- Session 2 --

Part 1 : Human Thinking Pattern
			
		Fibonacci Series (story of Fibonacci rabbit)
			
		What is reccurance relation ?

		Recurive
		Dynamic programming (Concept of Cache)
		Iterative version
		    
Part 2 : Pattern printing 

    		Upper triangular matrix
    		Upper triangluar matrix
    		Pyramid matrix


Home Work : 

    		Program of nCr (Combinations and Permutations)
    		Using C(n,r) = fact(n) / (fact(n-r)*fact(r)) 
    		Using reccurance relation : C(n,r) = C(n-1,r-1) + C(n-1,r)

			Print Pascal triangle


-- Session 3 --

Part 1: Classes and Objects
        
       		Object Oriented Programming Concepts using Python
       
       
Part 2 : Linked List 

	     	Why do we need Linked List ? 
	     	Basic Operations
	     	Linked List as Stack , Queue
     
Home Work :

    		To understand all the programs and implement them in C/C++ 
    		from given python code
