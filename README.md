Programming with Python

-- Session 1 --

Part 1 : install python, setup batch file to run the code easily

Part 2 : Basics of Python

		Basic tutorial : (I/O, variable, conditional statements, Array, functions)
		Program of AP, GP  (using iteration only)
		Factorial (using iteration, Stack, Recursion)

Part 3 : installing external libraries using pip command example (graphics)

    draw shapes(Line, rectangle, circle, TextLabel)
    visualize factorial in concentric circles

Home Work : 

    draw concentric circles for AP, GP series
	  program of AP, GP using Recursion and Stack
	  addition program using arrays :  [9,9,9] + [9,9] = [1,0,9,8] 
													(asked in Google)

-- Session 2 --

Part 1 : Human Thinking Pattern
			
			Fibonacci Series (story of Fibonacci rabbit)
			
			What is reccurance relation ?

			 Recurive
			 Dynamic programming (Concept of Cache)
			 Iterative version
		    
Part 2 : Pattern printing 

    Upper triangular matrix
    Upper triangluar matrix
    Pyramid matrix


Home Work : 

    Program of nCr (Combinations and Permutations)
    using C(n,r) = fact(n) / (fact(n-r)*fact(r)) 
    using reccurance relation : C(n,r) = C(n-1,r-1) + C(n-1,r)

		Print Pascal triangle


-- Session 3 --

Part 1: Classes and Objects
        
       Object Oriented Programming Concepts in Python
       
       
Part 2 : Linked List 

     Why do we need Linked List 
     Basic Operations
     Linked List as Stack , Queue
     
Home Work :

    To understand all the programs and implement them in C/C++ 
    from given python code
